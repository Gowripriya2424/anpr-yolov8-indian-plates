# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using YOLOv8

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system using the YOLOv8 object detection framework. The primary objective is to accurately detect vehicle number plates from images, which forms the foundation of real-world ANPR systems used in traffic surveillance, parking automation, toll collection, and law enforcement.

The project focuses on **robust number plate detection**, designed to be scalable and extendable with OCR and real-time video processing.
